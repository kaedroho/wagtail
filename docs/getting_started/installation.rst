Like Django, Wagtail provides a command for starting a new project. Wagtail must be installed on your system or in a virtual environment before you can use it.

Wagtail is available on PyPI and can be installed using either ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.


With ``pip``:

 .. code-block:: bash

    pip install wagtail


With ``easy_install``:

 .. code-block:: bash

    easy_install wagtail
