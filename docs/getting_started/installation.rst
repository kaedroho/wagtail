Installation
============

Like Django, Wagtail provides a single command for starting a new project. In order to use it though, Wagtail must be installed on to your host machine.

Wagtail is available on PyPI and can be installed with either ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.


With ``pip``:

 .. code-block:: bash

    pip install wagtail


With ``easy_install``:

 .. code-block:: bash

    easy_install wagtail
