 Separated out of results.html to prevent invalid videos from crashing the entire
 videos listing. (issue #1805)

 If an error is raised inside a template include, the error is caught by the
 calling {% include %} tag and the contents blanked out.

 This behaviour caused a confusing error on the videos listing view where it
 would go blank if one of the videos was invalid.

 Separating the video rendering code into this file allows us to limit Django's
 crash/blanking behaviour to a single video so the listing can still be used when
 the issue occurs.
